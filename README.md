# CLGames
This particular repository was created for Impossible Day (July 2023) at Recurse Center!

The goal of Impossible Day is to work beyond the edge of your abilities â€”Â to do something you really didn't think you could do.

I gave myself the goal of building five command-line games. One thing that I've been struggling with is making myself buildâ€”I've been writing code daily for LeetCode (though I've sometimes been forgetting to put the code on GitHub!), but I've spent too much time on tutorials and LeetCode rather than building my own thing. So, I set myself a goal.

The games I decided to build and progress after one day:

âœ…  Mastermind: This was the first time I've used colour like this in a CLI game. I'm really pleased with how it turned out!

âœ…  Nordle: I created a flexible version of Wordle where you can play one, two (dordle), four (quordle), or eight (octordle) games at a time.
    It's still a little janky; the formatting messes up for 2+ boards when you get correct words, and I'm not sure why. To figure it out!
    
ðŸˆº  Blackjack: Super basic. Got barely into it at the end of the day (creating and shuffling a deck of cards).

ðŸ”³  Minesweeper: Didn't even start!

ðŸ”³  ????: Hadn't decided on a fifth project, but may have been an anagram solver! TBD.
